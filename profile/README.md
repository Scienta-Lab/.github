Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **Scienta Lab**. 

We develop **EVA**, a foundation model for immunology and inflammation (I&I) diseases, aiming at bridging the gap of translational research and predicting the effect of new therapeutics before they are tested in clinical trials.

Pre-trained on tens of millions of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq samples, EVA enables translational drug efficacy prediction, patient stratification, and therapeutic targets validation from preclinical data.
